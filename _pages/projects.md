I develop AI and robotics systems that bridge theory and practice, focusing on control systems, human-robot interaction, and dynamics-aware machine learning. Here are some highlights from my research and projects.

## Featured Projects

### Dynamics-Aware Diffusion Models for Planning and Control
*Current Research | 2023 - *

Developing diffusion models that understand system dynamics for improved robotic planning and control. This work addresses the challenge of incorporating physical constraints and system behavior into generative models for robotics applications.

**Key Contributions:**
- Novel integration of dynamical systems theory with diffusion models
- Improved planning accuracy for robotic systems
- Theoretical guarantees for stability and performance
