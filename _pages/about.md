I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at UC Riverside in the Mechanical Engineering department. My advisor is [Prof. Fabio Pasqualetti](https://www.fabiopas.it/). Broadly, my research is focused on analyzing the behavior of robotic systems and embodied AI agents driven by black-boxes. I use probabilistic tools in control theory and ML in my research. 

I recently interned at the Honda Research Institute where I worked on probing human drivers for intention inference. Previously, I was a Research Assistant with [Dr. Pavankumar Tallapragada](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/~pavant/) at the Indian Institute of Science. I got my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from RV College of Engineering, Bengaluru, India.
